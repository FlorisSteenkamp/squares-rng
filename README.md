# Squares: A Fast Counter-Based RNG (Random Number Generator)

* **Original author** (of paper and original C code) â†’ Bernard Widynski (squaresrng@gmail.com) 
* [**arXiv paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06278v2.pdf) (May 5, 2020)
* [**Website with original C code**](https://squaresrng.wixsite.com/rand)

## Advantages

* **Predictive (pure function)** â†’ For any integer, n, squares(n) will always produce the
same 'random' number.
* **Counter-based (think mappable, stateless)** â†’ Each next random number is *not* based on a previous one; 
rather, a random number is simply a function of the non-negative integers
(*â„•â‚€* â‰¡ (0, 1, 2, 3, ... )), i.e. `squares` â‰¡ f: *â„•â‚€* â†’ *â„•â‚€* but limited to the
range [0,0xffffffff] (=== [0,2^32-1] === [0,4294967295]). Note that this limitation
is due to JavaScript's limitation being unable to handle unsigned 64-bit integers,
but may be overcome in many ways (e.g. BigNum, low/high 32-bit nibbles, etc) if 
really needed - it is not a limitation of the original algorithm.
* **Fast** â†’ From the arXiv paper: "...one of the fastest counter-based RNGs". It 
produces about 50 million 'random' numbers on my 1st gen. Intel i7 per second, but
the original algorithm can do about 1000 million / second - the reason for the slowdown
is probably due to the original author's code being inlined (i.e. no function call overhead) 
and possibly to a lesser extend the fact that WASM have to convert from u32 to f64 on 
each call (again, necessary for compatibility with JavaScript).
* **Crush-proof** â†’ Passes statistical [BigCrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestU01) tests
* **Synchronous WASM** â†’ no `Promise`s or `async` required! (due to the WASM Module 
being read from a static Base64 string and not from a file or url)

## Browser support

Basically any browser supporting WebAssembly - most major browsers since October 2017.

* **No** â†’ IE 11
* **Yes** â†’ Chrome 57+, Edge 16+, Firefox 53+, Safari 11+, Opera 44+

code efficiency improvements.

ðŸ¤© Built with [**Assembly**Script](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) ðŸ¤©

# Installation

```cli
npm install squares-rng
```

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
and can be used in `Node.js` (or in a browser when bundled using e.g. Webpack).

Additionally, self-contained `ECMAScript Module` (ESM) files `index.js` and
`index.min.js` in the `./browser` folder is provided.

Or, if you need a legacy browser script there is also `index.js`
and `index.min.js` in the `./browser` folder. Either script exposes a global 
variable called SquaresRNG.

# Usage

## Node.js
```JavaScript
import { squares, squares4 } from "squares-rng";

squares(100);   //=> 1083911291
squares(100);   //=> 1083911291
squares4(100);  //=> 843037697
squares4(100);  //=> 843037697

// Need random numbers (as double floats) in [0,1] (including 0, but excluding 1)
squares(1) / 0x1_0000_0000;  //=> 0.846250728238374
squares(2) / 0x1_0000_0000;  //=> 0.08598547801375389
squares(3) / 0x1_0000_0000;  //=> 0.48831595154479146
squares(4) / 0x1_0000_0000;  //=> 0.31984469038434327
squares(5) / 0x1_0000_0000;  //=> 0.2340635354630649
```

### Browsers - directly, without a bundler, using the pre-bundled minified .js file

Please note that no tree shaking will take place in this case.

```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <script type="module">
        import { squares, squares4 } from "./node_modules/squares-rng/browser/index.min.js";

        squares(100);   //=> 1083911291
        squares4(100);  //=> 843037697
        // Need random numbers as double floats in [0,1]? (including 0, but excluding 1)
        squares(1) / 0x1_0000_0000;  //=> 0.846250728435407
    </script>
</head>

<body>Check the console.</body>

</html>
```

### Bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, ...)

Webpack will be taken as an example here.

Since your webpack config file might still use `CommonJS` you must rename 
`webpack.config.js` to `webpack.config.cjs`.

If you are using TypeScript:

Since this is an [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
library you must use [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin) 
(at least until webpack catches up with ESM?) in your `webpack.config.cjs` file.

```cli
npm install --save-dev resolve-typescript-plugin
```

and follow the instructions given at [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin).

Additionally, follow this [guide](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-make-my-typescript-project-output-esm).
